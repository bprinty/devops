Overview
--------

The purpose of this project is to provide a substitute for using a VirtualBox/VMWare provider with Vagrant. Using Docker as a Vagrant provider requires less computational overhead and simplifies use across heterogeneous systems.

See the Vagrantfile in this repository for an example of how to scaffold a project with Vagrant, Docker, and Ansible.
